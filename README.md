# Magic 8 Ball

Welcome to the **Magic 8 Ball**, a digital twist on the classic fortune-telling toy! Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project brings a sleek, animated 8 Ball to your screen. Ask a yes-or-no question, click the button (or hit Enter), and let the ball reveal its cryptic wisdom.

- **Easter Eggs**: A 1/50 chance to unlock quirky, hidden answers (keep shaking!).
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Includes a subtle vibration effect on supported devices.
- **Responsive Design**: Scales beautifully from desktop to mobile screens.
- **Interactive**: Click the button or press Enter to get your answer.
